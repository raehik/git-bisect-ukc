I spent what ~~probably~~ definitely amounts to *days* poring over this problem
with others and by myself. Lots of fun, sometimes infuriating. I resolved to use
Haskell, which I now know means I enjoy inflicting pain on myself.

I found out some cool things about the problem and Haskell. The `docs` directory
is where most of my notes and such went, I've kept this README relatively lean.
